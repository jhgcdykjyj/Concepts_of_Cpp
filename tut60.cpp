/*
The useful classes for working with files in C++ :
1. fstreambase
2. ifstream --> derived from fstream.
3. ofstream --> derived from fstream.

In order to work files in C++, you will have to open it,
Their are two ways to open a file:
1. using the __cpp_delegating_constructors
2. using the member function open of the class
